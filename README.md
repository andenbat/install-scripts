for installation of config 1 to setup network volume 1:
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andenbat/install-scripts/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh```


for installation of config 2 to setup network volume 2:
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andenbat/install-scripts/main/install2.sh
chmod +x install2.sh
./install2.sh```




-> note to future self: rn my process is to ssh or open jupyter notebook in/on the pod/contanier and run these commands, i SHOULD REALLY use runpod CLI and change this repo to include the setup, start and stop, so i can create the network volume and document the process in cooodeeee....
